# Purpose

[Personal Page](https://devjunhong.github.io/)

To land my personal page with github, I implement with one boostrap template. It's named "grayscale". 

[Grayscale the template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)

# Usage

It's really simple. You can clone it and click the "index.html". That's all.
